# Module_VRMode
The VRMode Module is used to develop non-XR full-screen apps for the  XR devices, which provides a way to switch to a non-XR full-screen mode.



## Using Module_VRMode

This Module is included in SDK by default. If you need to develop a non-full-screen XR mode APP, you just need to delete the Module_VRMode directory, located at **SDK/Modules/Module_VRMode**.

**Note:** This VRMode Module only affects the apps in the  XR devices.
